# Getting Started with MVI using Mosby

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/MosbyMVI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jshvarts/MosbyMVI)

My article covering this repo: [Building reactive Android apps with MVI](https://proandroiddev.com/writing-reactive-apps-with-mvi-f7de70739d59)

This repo introduces Model-View-Intent pattern on Android using Mosby. 

I've seen some MVI examples that are much more complex (using State Reducers, etc). The problem is they are harder to grasp for a newcomer who just wants to get a sense of what MVI is about. So I decided to create this basic Hello World example implemented with MVI pattern. Hopefully, after seeing this code, for some of you it will "just click" what MVI on Android is all about and it will pave a way for you to build full-featured apps with MVI going forward.
